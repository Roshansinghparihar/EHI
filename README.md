# EHI
# Uploaded EHI project on Github and completed whatever was possible till this time as on this weekend i was very busy with some very urgent personal work. logic is implemented but finishing touch is left and if you want to complete full project then please provide me next weekend time as will not find any time on week days.

There are 5 projects added here:
EHI - Web application
EHI.WebApi - Web api application
EHI.DAL - Data access layer
EHI.BAL  -  Business layer
EHI.Models  -  Class library

Web application contains "ManageContactList.aspx" as main page where GUI and logics are available

Web api application contains "EHIContactListController" controller class for exposing GET method (Note -> Found time only to expose GET method, for other Insert/Delete/Update method to implement in Web api, i need some more time)

DAL project contains "EHIContactListDAL" class to interact with database

BAL project contains "EHIContactListBAL" class to interact with DAL



Note -> I used N-unit with Moq for unit testing in my project. So implement this feature with this project again i need some more time.
